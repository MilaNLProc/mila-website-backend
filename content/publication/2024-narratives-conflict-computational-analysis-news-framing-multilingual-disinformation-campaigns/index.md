abstract: Any report frames issues to favor a particular interpretation by highlighting
  or excluding certain aspects of a story. Despite the widespread use of framing in
  disinformation, framing properties and detection methods remain underexplored outside
  the English-speaking world. We explore how multilingual framing of the same issue
  differs systematically. We use eight years of Russia-backed disinformation campaigns,
  spanning 8k news articles in 4 languages targeting 15 countries. We find that disinformation
  campaigns consistently and intentionally favor specific framing, depending on the
  target language of the audience. We further discover how Russian-language articles
  consistently highlight selected frames depending on the region of the media coverage.
  We find that the two most prominent models for automatic frame analysis underperform
  and show high disagreement, highlighting the need for further research.
