abstract: 'Due to the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), we need to understand
  whether they embed a specific “worldview” and what these views reflect. Recent studies
  report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings
  (Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024). However, it is as yet unclear whether
  these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning
  is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests
  which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs’ stances on political statements
  based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries
  and annotated for policy issues. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters
  and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show
  overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs:
  They show a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare
  state, and liberal society but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent
  preferences in the areas of foreign policy and migration.'
