I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.gu.se/en/political-science) at the University of Gothenburg. In my research I use machine learning and NLP tools to study political behavior and political communication. In my dissertation I study elite polarization using data from social media and in parliaments, but I also do work using historical data and on geographical representation.

I am visiting researcher at MilaNLP during February 2025 to June 2025.
