abstract: Current automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are designed to be used
  across many languages and tasks without substantial changes. However, this broad
  language coverage hides performance gaps within languages, for example, across genders.
  Our study systematically evaluates the performance of two widely used multilingual
  ASR models on three datasets, encompassing 19 languages from eight language families
  and two speaking conditions. Our findings reveal clear gender disparities, with
  the advantaged group varying across languages and models. Surprisingly, those gaps
  are not explained by acoustic or lexical properties. However, probing internal model
  states reveals a correlation with gendered performance gap. That is, the easier
  it is to distinguish speaker gender in a language using probes, the more the gap
  reduces, favoring female speakers. Our results show that gender disparities persist
  even in state-of-the-art models. Our findings have implications for the improvement
  of multilingual ASR systems, underscoring the importance of accessibility to training
  data and nuanced evaluation to predict and mitigate gender gaps. We release all
  code and artifacts at https://github.com/g8a9/multilingual-asr-gender-gap.
