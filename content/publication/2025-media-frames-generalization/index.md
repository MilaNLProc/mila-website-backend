abstract: 'Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously
  make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse
  on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter
  data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent
  on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended
  to focus strongly on manifestos (parties’ electoral programs) rather than social
  media.In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional
  similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using
  hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual
  annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments
  that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that
  our method yields stable positionings reflective of manifesto positionings, both
  in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only
  smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available. This indicates that it
  is possible to reliably analyze the relative positioning of actors without the need
  for manual annotation, even in the noisier context of social media.'
