abstract: |
  Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make
  statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse
  on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals.

  However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and
  often dependent on social context. Recent work on political positioning has tended
  to focus strongly on manifestos (parties’ electoral programs) rather than social media.

  In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional
  similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using
  hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation.
