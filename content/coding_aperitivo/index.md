The Coding Aperitivo is our take on a weekly seminar series. We end the working week and wind down with some relaxed academic chatter, a drink and some snacks. 

### Dirk's Negroni
When in Milan, drink as the Milanese. Though the official recipe calls for equal parts gin, Campari and red vermouth, here we opt for a punchier negroni, heavy on the gin. For a sbagliato, substitute the gin for prosecco.

- 3-4 parts gin (to taste)
- 2 parts campari
- 1 part red vermouth. 

Pour the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until the glass feels very cold. Strain into a glass with a (very) large ice cube and a twist of orange (and rub the glass rim with it). 


## Format 
The sessions are hybrid (online/in-person), with the guest generally being remote. As well as our guest, we also have an internal whiteboard-only talk about current work or a topic that has been tugging at our heartstrings. 

We encourage our guests to try different formats with us such as guided discussions, hands-on activities, [PechaKucha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha), debates or just a nice academic chat. Got some research ideas you and you want a sounding board? We are very happy to to discuss ongoing or upcoming research. 

In previous sessions, some guests have:

- Used the [Jigsaw method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)) in order to introduce a topic in a hands-on manner. 
- Introduced a premise for debate, then separated the audience into two teams to discuss among ourselves, finally bringing the teams together in order argue their points. 
- Used one existing work as a basis for questioning our assumptions about the research process
- Briefly presented ongoing work, highlighting challenges or potential research avenues to discuss.
- Given us a hands-on activity (e.g. data annotation) meant to highlight the challenges of a particular task.
