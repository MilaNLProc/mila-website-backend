I am a postdoctoral researcher at the MilaNLP Lab at Bocconi University. I completed my PhD in the [Social Computing Group](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg.html) at the University of Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Anikó Hannák](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg/people/hannak.html). I am broadly interested in the societal effects of AI. During my PhD, I worked extensively on algorithmic fairness and algorithmic collective action as ways to contest power imbalances. I am also interested in the promises and risks of using LLMs for social science methods. Visit my [website](http://joebaumann.org/) for more information.
