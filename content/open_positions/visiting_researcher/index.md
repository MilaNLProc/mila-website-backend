We love hosting talented researchers for research visits at MilaNLP. If you would like to apply for a visit, read on.

We have two main visiting periods: between **April and July**, and between **September and December**.
We try to assess all applications for a period together and make a decision with enough time to spare, usually in **January and July**.

Most of our visitors are PhD students or postdocs, i.e., people who do not have their own funding. This program is designed to help them come for a visit. If you do have your own funding, please feel free to reach out directly.

Due to limited office space, we will only be able to host 1â€“2 people per period.

**NOTE: Due to the overwhelming response, we have already filled all slots for 2024, but will run another round in 2025. Please keep an eye out on social media for the announcement.**
