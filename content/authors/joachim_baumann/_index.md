Since January 2025, I have been a visiting researcher at the MilaNLP Lab. I am a PhD student in the [Social Computing Group](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg.html) at the University of Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Anikó Hannák](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg/people/hannak.html).
I am broadly interested in the societal effects of AI. During my PhD, I have worked extensively on algorithmic fairness and algorithmic collective action as ways to contest power imbalances.
I am also interested in the promises and risks of using LLMs for political fact-checking, as well as for social science methods more generally.
