**Matthias Orlikowski** is a visiting PhD student from Bielefeld University (Germany), where he is part of the [Semantic Computing Group](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/arbeitsgruppen/semantic-computing/team/matthias-orlikowski/). At MilaNLP, he is working on modelling socio-demographic information in automatic detection of hateful statements online. In addition to detection, he researches computational approaches to mitigate hateful speech in social media discussions to support organized counterspeech and community moderation.
