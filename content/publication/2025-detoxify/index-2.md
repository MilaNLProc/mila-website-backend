abstract: Toxic language online poses growing challenges for content moderation. Detoxification,
  which rewrites toxic content into neutral form, offers a promising alternative but
  remains underexplored beyond English. We present Detoxify-IT, the first Italian
  dataset for this task, featuring toxic comments and their human-written neutral
  rewrites. Our experiments show that even limited fine-tuning on Italian data leads
  to notable improvements in content preservation and fluency compared to both multilingual
  models and LLMs used in zero-shot settings, underlining the need for language-specific
  resources. This work enables detoxification research in Italian and supports broader
  efforts toward safer, more inclusive online communication.
