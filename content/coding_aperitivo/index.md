> *"Have a negroni. Have two. Be open to a world where you may not understand or agree with the person next to you, but have a drink with them anyways."*
> *--Anthony Bourdain*

The Coding Aperitivo is our take on a weekly seminar series. We end the working week and wind down with some relaxed academic chatter, a drink and some snacks. 


## Format 
We usually host external speakers on Fridays at 4pm Milan time.
Talks are mostly virtual, and sometimes in person.
We encourage our guests to try different formats with us such as guided discussions, hands-on activities, debates or just a nice academic chat.
Got some research ideas you and you want a sounding board?
We are very happy to discuss ongoing or upcoming research.

## Dirk's Drinks
When in Milan, drink as the Milanese. There are many excellent drink options, but they all start with a bitter and a red vermouth. The big names here are Campari and Martini, but there are plenty of other options worth exploring. Though the official recipes call for equal parts bitter and red vermouth, here we opt for a punchier taste, heavier on the bitter.

### Base:
- 3 parts bitter
- 2 parts red vermouth

### Options:
You can now take this into several directions, by adding different mixers:
- 3 parts sparkling water (or fill it up) will get you an *Americano* (not to be confused with the coffee drink of the same name)
- For an interesting and refreshing twist, try tonic water instead of sparkling
- 3 parts prosecco get you a *negroni sbagliato* (the "messed up negroni")
- 3 parts gin get you the original *negroni*
- 3 parts bourbon get you a *boulevardier*

Pour the ingredients into a mixing glass with some ice and stir until the glass feels very cold. Strain into a glass with a large ice cube (the larger the better: it will melt more slowly) and a twist of orange or lemon peel (and rub the glass rim with it). 
Enjoy!
