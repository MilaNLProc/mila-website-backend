<!-- I am a <s>first-year</s> <s>second-year</s> third year PhD student Computation, Cognition and Language at the [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/).
I have broad interests in natural language processing and computational social science. Most recently, my research encompasses two aspects: 1) understanding the inherent biases of LLMs through text generation 2) employing LLMs to understand biased language use in human communication.
Previously, I completed my master's in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My master's thesis is about quotative usage in U.S political news. It was done at [The Data Science Lab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), supervised by [Manoel Horta Ribeiro](https://manoelhortaribeiro.github.io/), [Prof. Andreas Spitz](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/aspitz/) and [Prof. Robert West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/).     

I obtained a Bachlor's of Science in Electrical Engineering from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Carlos Busso](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~busso/). I worked on driver head pose estimation with 3D data. -->
