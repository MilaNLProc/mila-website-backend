abstract: 'Persistent societal biases like misogyny express themselves more often
  implicitly than through openly hostile language.However, previous misogyny studies
  have focused primarily on explicit language, overlooking these more subtle forms.
  We bridge this gap by examining implicit misogynistic expressions in English and
  Italian. First, we develop a taxonomy of social dynamics, i.e., the underlying communicative
  intent behind misogynistic statements in social media data. Then, we test the ability
  of nine LLMs to identify the social dynamics as a multi-label classification and
  text span selection: first LLMs must choose social dynamics given a prefixed list,
  then they have to explicitly identify the text spans that triggered their decisions.
  We also investigate the extent of using different learning settings: zero and few-shot,
  and prescriptive. Our analysis suggests that LLMs struggle to follow instructions
  and reason in all settings, mostly relying on semantic associations, recasting claims
  of emergent abilities.'
