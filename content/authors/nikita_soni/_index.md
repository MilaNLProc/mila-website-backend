**Nikita Soni** is a PhD student at Stony Brook University, New York, with research focus on making Natural Language Processing about more than words. She is visiting MilaNLP at Bocconi for Fall 2022. She is enthused about NLPâ€™s expanding outreach in our lives and its unexplored abilities to understand human nature better and more efficiently than ever. Language is more than words, it expresses identities, psychologies, cultures and much more. She finds herself challenged in directing NLP language models to look beyond the current limitations and consider the human behind the language. The purpose of her research is to enable the growth of more empathy in an AI-future centric world, thereby augmenting humanity rather than detracting from it.
