abstract: "Predictive models make mistakes and have biases. To combat both, we need\
  \ to understand their predictions.Explainable AI (XAI) provides insights into models\
  \ for vision, language, and tabular data. However, only a few approaches exist for\
  \ speech classification models. Previous works focus on a selection of spoken language\
  \ understanding (SLU) tasks, and most users find their explanations challenging\
  \ to interpret.We propose a novel approach to explain speech classification models.\
  \ It provides two types of insights. (i) Word-level. We measure the impact of each\
  \ audio segment aligned with a word on the outcome. (ii) Paralinguistic. We evaluate\
  \ how non-linguistic features (e.g., prosody and background noise) affect the outcome\
  \ if perturbed.We validate our approach by explaining two state-of-the-art SLU models\
  \ on two tasks in English and Italian. We test their plausibility with human subject\
  \ ratings. Our results show that the explanations correctly represent the model\u2019\
  s inner workings and are plausible to humans."
