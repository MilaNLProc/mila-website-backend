**Amanda Cercas Curry** is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Bocconi University](https:\\www.bocconi.it/). Her research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, specifically on open-domain conversational systems, their social impact and how we can develop more ethical AI across disciplines. During her PhD, she worked on abuse detection and mitigation in dialogue systems particularly when it comes to female digital assitants. During her PhD, she led her university’s team in the 2018 Amazon Alexa Challenge during which they were finalists. She also co-hosts the podcast “Let’s Chat Ethics” which covers current issues in AI Ethics.
