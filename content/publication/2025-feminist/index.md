abstract: 'Understanding how words shift in meaning is crucial for analyzing societal
  attitudes.In this study, we investigate the contextual variations of the terms feminist,
  feminists along three axes: time, language, and domain.To this aim, we collect and
  release FEMME, a dataset comprising the occurrences of such terms from 2014 to 2023
  in English, Italian and Swedish in Twitter, Reddit and Incel domains.Our methodology
  leverages frame analysis, as well as fine-tuning and LLMs. We find that the connotation
  of the plural form feminists is consistently more negative than feminist, indicating
  more hostility towards feminists as a collective, which often triggers greater societal
  pushback, reflecting broader patterns of group-based hostility and stigma. Across
  languages, we observe similar stereotypes towards feminists that often include body
  shaming, as well as accusations of hypocrisy and irrational behavior. In terms of
  time, we identify events that trigger a peak in terms of negative or positive connotation.As
  expected, the Incel spheres show predominantly negative connotations, while the
  general domains show mixed connotations.'
