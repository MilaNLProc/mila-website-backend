We love hosting talented researchers for research visits at MilaNLP.
Most of our visitors are PhD students.
We have two main visiting periods: between April and July, and between September and December.
We will try to assess all applications for a period together and make a decision with enough time to spare.
Due to limited space, we will only be able to host 1â€“2 people per period.

**NOTE: Due to the overwhelming response, we have already filled all slot for 2024, but will run another round in 2025. Please keep an eye out on social media for the announcement.**
